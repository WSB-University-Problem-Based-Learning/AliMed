## Typography

- Logo typeface: Lunchtype24 by Stefan Wetterstrand (SIL OFL; szczegóły w `LICENSE`).
- Recommended UI typeface pairing: system default sans-serif stack (e.g., `"Inter", "Segoe UI", "Roboto", sans-serif`) for clarity and cross-platform availability.

## Asset Storage

- Graphic assets live under `res/` and are grouped by type.
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `logo.png`, `logo-dark.svg`) to keep future variants organized.
